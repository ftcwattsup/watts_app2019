1. Get down from lander and unhook
2. Kick the gold mineral
3. Drop team marker
4. Park on the crater

Init:
init servos and motors (! make sure hook servo doesn't move)
init vuforia

1:
Move hook servo.
Slow extend the slider, until the robot is on the floor. (Check if on floor with color/range sensor)
Move a bit to the side. (Maybe a bit forward?)

2.
Use Tensorflow and Vuforia to get the gold mineral position.
Move forward a specific distance. (Hope the encoders are accurate on mecanum!?)
Move in front of the gold mineral.
Push the gold mineral.
Get back in front of the minerals.

3.
Move to the wall until a specific distance.
Rotate 45 degrees (being paralell to the wall).
Move to the depot.
Drop the team marker.

4.
Move backwards until the crater is reached.


Sensors needed:
Gyro (in REV)
Distance sensor pointing to the floor.
Distance sensor pointing forward. (for depot)
